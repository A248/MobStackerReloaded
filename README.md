# MobStackerReloaded

## Introduction

Sometimes players just make too many farms.
Countless hordes of zombies, golems, pigs, sheep, and all other sorts of mobs fill their grinders.

You may have noticed the massive hit you've been taking too performance, but you don't want to remove players' incentive to farm, either.

## Solution

You need a plugin to **stack** mobs. MobStackerReloaded does just that. It combines numerous mobs into a **stack**.
The stack is simply a merged mob, which will grant players the same amount of loot as they would from unmerged mobs.
